1. How to achieve bounded delay(hard to achieve)(P286)
(1) QoS(Quality of Service): technique that manages data traffic to reduce
packet loss, latenc, jitter
(2) admission control: check before establishing connection

2. LWW(Last Write Wins) widely accepted, problem on physical time decision:
(1) clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME): could jump forward or backward
(2) clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC): deesn't represent absolute time. but
guarentee monotonous on single machine(actually single CPU)
(3) could sync-up by NTP(Network Tiime Protocal)
	potential problem: NTP daemon misconfiguration, firewall blocks NTP traffic,
	clock error due to drift becomes large

3. process could suspend, don't make assumptions upon that
(1) suspension reason: P296
(2) bad code example: P296

4. The truth is defined by the majority.

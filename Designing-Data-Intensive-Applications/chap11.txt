1. Why not direct communication between producers and consumers?
(1) speed mismatch(message broker buffers)
(2) what if node failure? (message broker provides fault tolerance)

2. How to keep systems in sync?
(1) periodical full database dump, but could be slow
(2) dual write: application directly makes updates, but not viable
problems: 1/ updates not in the same order
2/ some updates succeed, others fail
(3) use message broker as middleware

3. log-based message broker:
(1) provides total ordering within partition, no ordering guarentee across
partitions
(2) could be used to keep heterogeneous consumers in sync(eg, data warehouse,
search index, etc)
(3) logs stored at circular bounded buffer on disk

4. How stream system achieves fault tolerance?
(1) implement mini-batching, which consists of bounded input data
(2) apply fault tolerance strategy used by batch system

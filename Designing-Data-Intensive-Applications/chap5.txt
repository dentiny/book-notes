How to set up a new follower?
(1) get snapshot of primary
(2) copy it to secondary
(3) follower requests changes since primary snapshot

replication log problem caused by read on secondary:
since replication log is not promised to replicate on secondary, only eventual 
consistency guarenteed
(1) read-your-writes consistency
	1/ always read from primary
	2/ keep timestamp, and ensure timestamp monotonously increase(Zookeeper)
(2) monotonic read(read version m after reading version n, where m < n)
(3) consistent prefix read(causal consistency)

multi-leader replication:
(1) use case: multi-datacenter operation: every datacenter has own leader
(2) cannot perform synchronous conflict detection
(3) avoidance: particular record goes to only one leader(eg: partition)
(4) automatic conflict resolution(P174):
1/ conflict-free replicated datatypes
2/ mergeable persistent data structure
3/ operational transformation(conflict resolution algorithm)

leader-less replication:
(1) read repair and anti-entropy process:
1/ when reading, detect lagging replicas and sync them up
2/ look for difference in data between replicas and copy missing from one to
another

improvement on quorum-based protocal: sloppy quorum and hinted handoff(DynamoDB)
(1) when quorum is not met(maybe because of a temporary network offline), store 
it to a server which is not in the replication group
(2) after the replica server comes back, pass the data back to it

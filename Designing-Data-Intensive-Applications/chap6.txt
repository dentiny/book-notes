consideration for partitioning:
(1) locality(eg: key range)
(2) repartitioning(add/remove node)
(3) even load distribution(relieve hotspot)

two main partitioning:
(1) key-range partitioning
1/ bad for load distribution, good for locality
2/ could parition into sub-partition for hotspot
(2) hash partitioning

secondary index:
(1) local index(document-paritioned index): only stores index for this node
(2) global index(term-partitioned index): stores index globally as primary key

service directory(request routing):
(1) client knows about partitioning
(2) routing tier, also as load balancer
(3) nodes know full partitioning
	client could contact any node, either accept locally or forward to another

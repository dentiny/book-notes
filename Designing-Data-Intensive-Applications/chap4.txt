network dataflow:
(1) RPC
flaw: 1/ network status unpredictable, whether could get result, and latency
2/ hard to locate problem(too many points could go wrong)
3/ retry implementation needs idempotence
4/ encode and decode overhead

(2) message broker:
1/ act as buffer to mitigate sender and receiver status(unavailable, overloaded)
2/ redeliver message if no response
3/ one message could be sent to multiple recipients
4/ decouple senders from recipients

reliability:
(1) fault vs failure
fault: a component of the system deviate from its spec
faulure: the system as a whole stops providing the required service
(2) fault-tolerance handling works for hardware faults, and planned downtime
(3) how to handle: thorough testing; process isolation(sandboxing); measure, 
monitor and analyze

scalability:
(1) identify key parameter of scalability
twitter example: P11-13
(2) performance evaluation: throughput, response time
note:
response time: interval between user issues and receives
latency: interval request waits to be handled
(3) prefer percentile over mean and median(SLO, SLA)
(4) one reason why response time's terrible: head-of-line blocking(tail latency)

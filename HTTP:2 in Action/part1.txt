HTTP/0.9: single request and reply
HTTP/1.1:
(1) persistent TCP connection
	Connection: Keep-alive
	Connection: Close
(2) pipelining: concurrently request and respond multiple resources, but suffer
HOL(Head-of-Line) blocking
(3) workaround:
	1/ multiple TCP connections
		eg: domain sharding(at most 6 connection for a domain)
	2/ spritting:
		- bundle resources into big files
		- resource inlining, eg: embed image into HTML
	3/ caching
(4) in a word, HTTP/2 is a synchronous request and response

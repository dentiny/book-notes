HTTP/2:
1. binary rather then textual
2. multiplexed rather than synchronous
  - only one TCP connection, HTTP/1.1 will open multiple TCP connections
    Why HTTP/1.1 slow? TCP three-way handshaking, SSL establishment, slow start
  - one connection could have multiple streams; a may contain multiple frames
  - HTTP/2 framing layer is responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing
3. stream prioritization
  - stream dependency
  - stream weighing
 4. header compression
  HPACK(static table, dynamic table, huffman coding)
 5. server push server respond more than one resource for one request
  - eliminate the need for spritting(concatenation and resource inlining)
  - con: overpushing: push unused resources, waste bandwidth
  - preload: client-side indicate resource it would require while loading

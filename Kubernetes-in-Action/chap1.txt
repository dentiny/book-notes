1. Kubernetes organize components in the unit of containers, rather than VMs,
which leverages Linux virtualization technology.

2. Kubernetes exposes the whole datacenter as a single computational resource
for running applications, it can be thought of as OS for the cluster.

3. functionality:
(1) service discovery
(2) load balancing
(3) health checking and self-healing
(4) simplify application deployment(indicated via config files)
(5) automatic scaling: detect resource insufficiency and request more actively

4. application-oriented: 
eg: (1) load-balancing is performed in the unit of application, rather than machine
(2) log is keyed by application
